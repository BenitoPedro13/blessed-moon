## 0. Project context — Blessed Moon Studio website

**Design-handoff route scope complete.** Next.js + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui are installed, the
brand design tokens are wired into the dark theme (`TASK-scaffold-nextjs.md`), and all four
routes are implemented (`TASK-finish-studio-subpages.md`). The full
design handoff lives in `docs/design-handoff.md` (screens, tokens, interactions, files) plus
`docs/design/wireframes.dc.html` (static wireframe reference) and
`docs/design/screenshots/*.png` (captures of the four selected screens).
`docs/design-handoff.md` is the source of truth for structure, copy, and design tokens — do
not duplicate its content here; this file covers *how to work*, not *what to build*. The root
`README.md` is the implementation README (setup, scripts, status).

Blessed Moon Studio is a software/web design agency. This repo is its marketing site:
homepage + Work, About, Contact subpages. Chosen direction: **dark, terminal/TUI-inspired,
full-bleed WebGL ASCII canvas background that morphs on scroll**, amber (`#ff6a1f`) accent
on near-black, sharp corners throughout (no border-radius — intentional, part of the TUI
aesthetic).

### Brand identity (for copy, tone, and component decisions)

- **Essence:** Illuminated precision. **Promise:** digital systems that are considered,
  reliable, and elevated. **Positioning:** technology that works with quiet excellence.
- **Audience:** founders, CTOs, and product leaders of growing companies who value
  craftsmanship and clear thinking over hype or lowest price.
- **Values:** Clarity, Craft, Integrity, Quiet confidence, Long-term thinking, Respect for
  attention and time — these are the About page's values chips; do not rephrase them.
- **Personality:** calm, precise, modern, slightly enigmatic, quietly premium (dark
  sophistication + warm orange light + technical soul).
- **Voice:** measured, clear, confident without volume; technical when needed, always
  human. Reference lines: *"Clarity is the feature."* (used as the hero headline),
  *"Built to last longer than the brief."* (About teaser heading).
- Any new copy written for this site (microcopy, error states, CTAs) should sound like it
  was written by the same voice — if it reads like generic SaaS marketing copy, it's wrong
  for this brand.

### Stack (per `docs/design-handoff.md` "About the Design Files")

| Layer | Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 16** (App Router, TypeScript, Turbopack, `src/` dir, `@/*` alias) — always the latest stable major, never a pinned number (see §2.0) | scaffolded |
| Styling / components | **Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui** — CSS-first config in `src/app/globals.css` (no `tailwind.config.*`); brand tokens (bg `#050505`, accent `#ff6a1f`, radius `0`, fonts) wired into the `.dark` theme block; `button`, `input`, `textarea`, `card`, `select` primitives installed | scaffolded |
| Atmosphere effect | Full-bleed ASCII moon background, scroll-driven zoom/rotation/drift, built on canvasui.dev's **AsciiObject** component (via shadcn CLI — see §2, `TASK-ascii-canvas-layer.md`). A hand-written raw-WebGL2 version was tried first and dropped in favor of this: AsciiObject's edge-aware glyph matching, DRACO support, and reduced-motion handling all beat what was being hand-rolled. Plus animate-ui's **StarsBackground** behind it, and canvasui's **ParticleObject** for the closing-CTA moment. `ParticleScroll` previously wrapped the homepage's post-Hero content as a content-dissolve panel with its own independent internal scroll — removed (`TASK-homepage-unify-scroll.md`): two disconnected scroll contexts was a real, repeated source of confusion, and the panel had to stay shorter than its content, capping section depth. The component stays in the codebase, just not wired into a live page — same status as `DecryptReveal`, whose native effect (like `ParticleScroll`'s) depends on the experimental, Chrome-only `html-in-canvas` API, gated per-origin by a Chrome Origin Trial (`TASK-html-in-canvas-origin-trial.md`) | built on homepage |
| Scroll journey | Lenis (`src/components/lenis-provider.tsx`) gives the whole site eased/smoothed native scroll — skipped entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`. `ScrollStage` (`src/components/scroll-stage.tsx`) pins **one** section for a taller scroll range via `position: sticky` (no scroll-jacking) and exposes progress as `--stage-progress` for children to fade/scale/transform against; used on Hero, the shared `PageHero`, and the subpages' sections. `ScrollMorphStage` (`src/components/scroll-morph-stage.tsx`) pins **several** in one shared sticky frame, all mounted at once and crossfading — which is what makes a real shared-element handoff possible, since two `ScrollStage` pins are never simultaneously on screen and so nothing can travel between them. It drives the whole homepage body; see `TASK-apple-scroll-journey.md` / `TASK-homepage-unify-scroll.md` / `TASK-homepage-morph-redesign.md`. **Two rules for content inside a morph layer:** a layer animates `opacity` only (a per-frame `transform` on an ancestor makes Motion's layout measurement drift mid-flight, so the token lands wrong), and `Reveal` does not work in there (it's `whileInView`-driven and every layer is permanently inside the viewport) — use `morphDrift()` instead | built site-wide |
| Sound / loading | Opt-in sound system (`src/components/sound-provider.tsx`, muted by default) and an interactive terminal boot sequence on load (`src/components/boot-sequence.tsx`) — sound-enable prompt, then a real scroll-to-begin gate (keyboard/button equivalents, fallback timeout so it can never trap a visitor) — `TASK-sound-and-boot.md`, `TASK-boot-sequence-gate.md` | built on homepage |
| Brand / SEO | Logo: a literal pixel-art crescent (`src/lib/logo-mark.ts`, one shared outline path) + `Blessed_Moon` wordmark, in the nav (`LogoMark`) and generated into the favicon, apple touch icon, and Open Graph/Twitter image via `next/og` `ImageResponse` (`src/app/icon.tsx`, `apple-icon.tsx`, `opengraph-image.tsx`, `twitter-image.tsx`). Metadata (title template, OG/Twitter tags, robots), `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts` all target `src/lib/site-config.ts`'s `SITE_URL` — `TASK-seo-favicon-and-logo.md` | built |
| Pages | `/`, `/work`, `/about`, `/contact` per `docs/design-handoff.md` Screens | complete — all four routes built, statically generated, responsive, and included in the sitemap (`TASK-finish-studio-subpages.md`) |
| Deployment target | Current production URL is `https://blessed-moon.vercel.app` (confirmed by the user, used as `SITE_URL` for SEO metadata) — whether that stays the final domain, or a custom domain gets attached later, is still open; don't assume otherwise without asking | live at a Vercel URL, final domain open |

**Version numbers written anywhere in this file or `docs/design-handoff.md` are a snapshot at
time of writing, not a pin.** Treat every one as potentially stale — see §2.0 before adding a
dependency.

### Things that must not break

- **No border-radius / sharp corners** — explicit intentional choice per the TUI aesthetic
  (`docs/design-handoff.md` Design Tokens; `--radius: 0rem` in `src/app/globals.css`). Don't
  let shadcn's default rounded corners slip back in on new components.
- **Dark theme only** — `<html class="dark">` is hardcoded in `src/app/layout.tsx`; this is
  not a site with a light-mode toggle, don't add one speculatively.
- **The ASCII effect must degrade gracefully.** Feature-detect WebGL support; a user without
  it should still get a fully readable, correctly laid-out page (plain dark background is an
  acceptable fallback) — never a blank or broken hero.
- **Section numbering (`01 / ABOUT`, `02 / SERVICES`, …) drives the scroll-morph keyframes**
  — it's a structural/interaction contract from the Dragonfly reference
  (`docs/design-handoff.md` References), not decorative. Don't renumber or drop a section
  without checking what keyframe it drove. On the homepage the `data-ascii-keyframe`
  attributes no longer sit on the sections themselves: absolutely positioned inside one
  sticky frame, all five report the same `getBoundingClientRect().top`, which the tracker
  can neither order nor interpolate between. `ScrollMorphStage` emits them as zero-size
  markers in its tall wrapper instead, at the scroll offset where each layer is centered.
- **Surfaces are cool, the accent is warm.** Every surface token in `globals.css` (`--border`,
  `--muted-foreground`, `--accent`, `--panel`, `--panel-edge`, `--cell-line`) carries a blue
  cast; the ground stays near-black and `#ff6a1f` stays the only hue with warmth. That
  contrast is what makes the amber read as light rather than as orange-on-grey — don't
  "fix" a surface token back to neutral white-alpha, and don't introduce a second accent
  colour, which is the wrong answer to a palette that feels thin.
- **The homepage body is ONE terminal window, not five panels.** `ScrollMorphStage` owns a
  single persistent `TerminalPanel`-styled frame whose width and height interpolate with
  scroll between each section's size, with the views crossfading inside it. It was built as
  five crossfading windows first and that was wrong: if the page's premise is one thing
  morphing, the window is a thing and it morphs too. The section eyebrow lives in that
  window's title bar — that's the one honest job for a number that isn't a sequence.
- **The homepage body's descending count (8 → 4 → 3 → 1) is the morph mechanism, not
  decoration** — each numeral is one DOM element handed between two sections via Motion's
  `layoutId` (`MorphToken`, `src/components/homepage/morph-count.tsx`). Changing a section's
  copy so its number no longer matches what the next section shows breaks the one thing the
  sequence is built around. Both sides of a handoff must stay in sync.
- **Wireframe copy and section order are final** per `docs/design-handoff.md` ("Fidelity").
  Colors/type are a starting palette, not locked — but section content and structure should
  not be silently rewritten; if something in the wireframe seems wrong, flag it before
  changing it.

### Start here

1. `docs/design-handoff.md` — the design handoff: screens, copy, interactions, design
   tokens, files, references.
2. `docs/design/wireframes.dc.html` + `docs/design/screenshots/*.png` — visual reference for
   the four selected screens (`homepage-1c`, `work-1d`, `about-1e`, `contact-1f`).
3. **Current route scope is complete:** `/work`, `/about`, and `/contact` now extend the ASCII
   canvas keyframes across their own sections. Any new route or production integration still
   requires a task document before code changes.

---

## 1. Plan before executing — write a task document first

**Rule:** Before editing or creating **any** code file, write a task document at
`docs/tasks/TASK-<slug>.md` describing the work. No exceptions for "small" changes.

This applies from the very first scaffold commit: no code exists yet, so the initial
`create-next-app` scaffold gets a task document before any file is created.

### 1.1 Required sections

Every task document must contain these four sections, in this order:

1. **Current scenario** — how it works today. What exists, what's missing or blocked. For
   the first tasks, this is simply "wireframe-only, no app code."
2. **Planned changes** — what will change, file by file. New behaviour, not just "edit X."
   Note any alternatives considered and rejected.
3. **Why** — justification with context. What does this unblock, what does it cost?
4. **Affected files** — a table:

   | File | Change type | Notes |
   |------|-------------|-------|
   | `app/page.tsx` | new | homepage per wireframe `1c` |
   | `components/ascii-canvas.tsx` | new | WebGL ASCII background layer |

### 1.2 How to apply it

- **Write the document silently.** Create the file, then point the user at it or summarize
  in 2–3 lines, and wait for alignment on anything significant before writing code.
- **One document per task / unit of work.** Short kebab-case slug:
  `TASK-scaffold-nextjs.md`, `TASK-ascii-canvas-layer.md`, `TASK-homepage-sections.md`.
- **Keep it in sync** if the plan changes mid-task — it's a living record, not write-once.
- **The document is the contract.** When scope is unclear, the task doc is the source of
  truth for what was agreed.

### 1.3 Why this matters

The user wants review and alignment before code is written — avoids work that gets
rejected, and leaves a trail of *why* a decision (e.g. how the ASCII shader is structured,
how scroll keyframes map to sections) was made, which won't be obvious from the code alone
later.

---

## 2. Use CLIs, generators, and SDKs — don't write everything by hand

**Rule:** Prefer invoking existing, canonical tooling over hand-authoring files a tool can
generate correctly.

### 2.0 Assume your framework knowledge is outdated — check first, every time

Frontend tooling moves fast, and this stack adds a fast-moving browser API (WebGL/Canvas)
on top. Before scaffolding anything or writing framework-specific code:

1. **Go to the framework's own current docs first** — Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui. Don't
   rely on remembered APIs or flags; they may already be wrong.
2. **Use the official CLI to scaffold/generate**, not a hand-written file:
   `pnpm create next-app@latest`, `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init` / `add <component>`.
3. **shadcn/ui specifically**: not a versioned dependency installed once — components are
   pulled into the repo via its CLI and the CLI/registry conventions change. Re-check its
   docs each time rather than reusing a pattern from memory. **Before any UI work**, load
   the `frontend-design:frontend-design` skill first and build with shadcn components
   rather than hand-rolled markup/CSS.
4. **Take the current major version as authoritative** over anything written in this file.
   If Next.js's own site says a newer major is current and stable, use that, and update
   this file's stack table to match (§3.1).
5. **WebGL/Canvas browser support and technique specifics**: verify current behaviour
   against the offscreencanvas.com references and MDN before building the shader layer —
   don't guess at WebGL API shape from memory.

### 2.1 What this looks like in practice

- **Scaffolding & generators.** `pnpm create next-app@latest`, `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add
  button input textarea card select`, `gh repo create`.
- **Run the command, then verify the output** rather than hand-recreating what a reliable
  generator already produces.
- **Use the agent's dedicated tools** (Read/Edit/Write/Grep) over improvised shell commands
  when one fits.
- **One package manager, decided at scaffold time, then never mixed.**

### 2.2 When to hand-write instead

No generator covers the ASCII/WebGL shader layer, scroll-morph keyframe logic, or the
specific restyling needed to match the design tokens — that's hand-written, matching
surrounding code style. If a WebGL API detail isn't something you can verify directly,
write `[VERIFY: ...]` rather than guessing.

### 2.3 Why this matters

Less human error, canonical and reproducible output, and — for the visual system
specifically — a result that actually matches shadcn's and Next.js's current conventions
instead of a stale pattern from training data.

---

## 3. Update documentation after executing

**Rule:** Before considering a task **done**, update all documentation affected by the
change.

### 3.1 What to check and update

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — if the change alters the stack, architecture, or any of §0's "things
  that must not break," update the corresponding section here.
- **`/system`** (`src/app/system/page.tsx`) — a new shared component added to
  `src/components/` gets a panel here as part of finishing its task; a shared component
  without a panel is an unfinished task, the same way a stale `README.md` is (see
  `TASK-system-design-page.md`).
- **`README.md`** — the *implementation* README (setup, scripts, status). Update when
  scripts, stack, or the "Status" section change.
- **`docs/design-handoff.md`** — the design spec (screens, tokens, interactions, references).
  Historical source of truth for *why* the design looks the way it does — update it only if
  a design decision genuinely changes (not just because the implementation differs slightly
  from the wireframe pixels).
- **`docs/tasks/`** — keep task docs in sync while work is in progress (§1.2).

### 3.2 How to apply it

Treat "docs updated" as an explicit checklist item before declaring a task complete. When
unsure whether a doc is affected, grep for the thing you changed (a section name, a design
token, a route) across `README.md`, `docs/design-handoff.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`.

### 3.3 Why this matters

The wireframe handoff already drifted once (this file previously described an unrelated
project). A doc that silently goes stale is how a future session ends up building against
the wrong spec.

---

## 4. Project conventions

**Rule:** Single Next.js app, not a monorepo — no need for workspace tooling unless a real
second package emerges.

- **Layout (current + proposed):**

  ```
  src/app/                  Next.js App Router routes: / (built) — /work, /about, /contact proposed;
                             /system — hidden, noindex design-system page, unlinked — built;
                             icon.tsx, apple-icon.tsx, opengraph-image.tsx, twitter-image.tsx,
                             robots.ts, sitemap.ts — generated brand/SEO assets — built
  src/components/ui/        shadcn primitives (button, input, textarea, card, select) — scaffolded
  src/components/canvasui/  canvasui.dev components via shadcn CLI: AsciiObject (moon bg),
                             ParticleObject (closing CTA), ParticleScroll (dissolve panel),
                             DecryptReveal (installed, currently unused) — built
  src/components/animate-ui/ StarsBackground via shadcn CLI — built
  src/components/homepage/  homepage-only section composites (hero, about-teaser, services-focus,
                             how-we-work, selected-work, pricing-table, closing-cta) — built.
                             The five between Hero and the CTA are layers of one
                             ScrollMorphStage (see morph-count.tsx for the 8→4→3→1 motif they
                             hand between them); Hero and closing-cta keep their own pins
  src/components/           shared composites (site-nav, site-footer, section-heading,
                             ascii-canvas, sound-provider, sound-toggle, boot-sequence,
                             logo-mark, scroll-stage, scroll-morph-stage, terminal-panel,
                             cell-grid) — built
  src/lib/                   shadcn's cn() helper etc.; ascii-canvas/scroll-progress.ts —
                             scroll-position tracker driving the moon's morph; logo-mark.ts —
                             shared pixel-crescent path; site-config.ts — SITE_URL — built
  public/sounds/              hover/click/toggle/ambient audio, CC0 — see README Credits
  public/models/               moon.glb — see TASK-ascii-canvas-layer.md for the asset pipeline
  docs/design-handoff.md    design spec (screens, tokens, interactions, references)
  docs/design/               wireframes.dc.html + screenshots/ (design reference assets)
  docs/tasks/                task docs (§1)
  ```

- **Package manager:** **pnpm** (decided at scaffold time via `TASK-scaffold-nextjs.md`),
  never mixed.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui, restyled to the design tokens in
  `docs/design-handoff.md` (already wired into `src/app/globals.css`) — don't introduce a
  second styling system (CSS-in-JS, another component library) alongside it.

**Why:** this is a marketing site, not a distributed system — the process should stay
lightweight and match the size of the problem, not import heavyweight process from
unrelated prior projects.

### 4.1 Commit conventions

- **Commit automatically once a task doc's work is complete and verified** (build/lint
  passing) — don't wait to be asked for each one. This is a standing authorization scoped
  to work that followed the task-doc process in §1; it is not blanket permission for
  destructive git operations (force-push, `reset --hard`, etc.), which still require
  explicit confirmation.
- **No `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** Commit messages in this repo do not carry a Claude
  co-authorship line — user preference, applies to every commit here regardless of the
  harness's default.

---

## TL;DR

| Phase | Rule | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Stack** | Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + canvasui.dev/animate-ui components (ASCII moon bg, particles, dissolve panel, star field) + sound + boot sequence + generated logo/favicon/OG/SEO | Single-app repo: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `docs/tasks/` |
| **Before** | Write a task document first | `docs/tasks/TASK-<slug>.md`: current scenario, planned changes (file by file), why, affected-files table |
| **During** | Use CLIs / generators — `create-next-app`, shadcn CLI; never hand-roll what a generator produces | Canonical, reproducible output; `[VERIFY: ...]` inline for anything unconfirmed (esp. WebGL/browser APIs) |
| **After** | Update `README.md` / `docs/design-handoff.md` / `CLAUDE.md` as needed, then commit — auto-committed once verified | Docs in sync, a commit |

**The loop:** plan → align → build with tooling → document → commit → done. **Never
broken:** sharp corners / no border-radius, dark-only theme, graceful WebGL fallback,
section numbering driving the moon's morph, wireframe copy treated as a starting point (not
locked — confirmed by the user) with changes flagged in the relevant task doc.
